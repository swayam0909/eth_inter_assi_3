# MyToken Smart Contract

This repository contains the smart contract for MyToken (ShibaInu), implemented in Solidity using OpenZeppelin libraries.

## Overview

MyToken is an ERC20 token with additional functionalities such as minting and burning, designed for use on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

- **Name**: ShibaInu
- **Symbol**: Shib
- **Total Supply**: 1000 tokens initially minted during contract deployment

## Features

1. **Transfer Tokens**: Users can transfer Shib tokens to other addresses.
2. **Mint Tokens**: Only the contract owner can mint new Shib tokens.
3. **Burn Tokens**: Users can burn their own Shib tokens, reducing the total supply.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Ethereum and Solidity
- Development environment set up with Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle)
- Familiarity with OpenZeppelin ERC20 and Ownable contracts

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. **Interact**: Use any Ethereum wallet or script to interact with the deployed contract.
   - Transfer tokens
   - Mint new tokens (owner only)
   - Burn tokens
